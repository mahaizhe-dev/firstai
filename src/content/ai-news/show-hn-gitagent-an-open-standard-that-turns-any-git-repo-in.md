We built GitAgent because we kept seeing the same problem: every agent framework defines agents differently, and switching frameworks means rewriting everything.GitAgent is a spec that defines an AI agent as files in a git repo.Three core files — agent.yaml (config), SOUL.md (personality/instructions), and SKILL.md (capabilities) — and you get a portable agent definition that exports to Claude Code, OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, Google ADK, LangChain, and others.What you get for free by being git-native:1. Version control for agent behavior (roll back a bad prompt like you'd revert a bad commit) 2. Branching for environment promotion (dev → staging → main) 3. Human-in-the-loop via PRs (agent learns a skill → opens a branch → human reviews before merge) 4. Audit trail via git blame and git diff 5. Agent forking and remixing (fork a public agent, customize it, PR improvements back) 6. CI/CD with GitAgent validate in GitHub ActionsThe CLI lets you run any agent repo directly:npx @open-gitagent/gitagent run -r https://github.com/user/agent -a claudeThe compliance layer is optional, but there if you need it — risk tiers, regulatory mappings (FINRA, SEC, SR 11-7), and audit reports via GitAgent audit.Spec is at https://gitagent.sh, code is on GitHub.Would love feedback on the schema design and what adapters people would want next.
